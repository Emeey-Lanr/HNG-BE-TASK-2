## COUNTRY API

Backend Task: Country Currency & Exchange API
 A RESTful API that fetches country data from an external API, stores it in a database, and provides CRUD operations.


 Fetch country data from: https://restcountries.com/v2/all?fields=name,capital,region,population,flag,currencies
 For each country, extract the currency code (e.g. NGN, USD, GBP).
 Then fetch the exchange rate from: https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD
 Match each country's currency with its rate (e.g. NGN → 1600). 
 Compute a field estimated_gdp = population × random(1000–2000) ÷ exchange_rate.
 Store or update everything in MySQL as cached data.
